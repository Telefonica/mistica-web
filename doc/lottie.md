# Optimizing bundles size when using Lotties

You may notice that when using `BrandLoadingScreen` component, the `lottie-web` package is imported lazily.
This package is a dependency of the `lottie-react` library that we use to render Lottie files.

There are several reports mentioning that `lottie-web` is quiet big, so their developers have created a
"light" version of it, that only supports some of the features
([Link](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web/wiki/Lottie-Light)).

If your use case of `lottie-react` library is not too complex and this light version covers your needs, you
can patch their library to import the `lottie-web` functionalities from `lottie-web/build/player/lottie_light`
instead. This will reduce the size of the library considerably.

You can refer to this [example patch](../.yarn/patches/lottie-react-npm-2.4.0-d4d95c55aa.patch) generated by
using `yarn patch` to understand how to update the `lottie-react` library. There is also
[a pull request](https://github.com/Gamote/lottie-react/pull/86) in their GitHub repository where you can see
the required diff in the `lottie-react` source code.
