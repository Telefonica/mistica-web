# Mistica Web

React component library for Telefonica's Design System.

## You are developing the library, not consuming it

This repository is the **source** of the `@telefonica/mistica` package. When you work here you are authoring
the library itself. Read the contributor documentation under `doc-internal/`:

- [`doc-internal/architecture.md`](./doc-internal/architecture.md) — source layout, styling model, authoring
  conventions.
- [`doc-internal/testing-internals.md`](./doc-internal/testing-internals.md) — test suites, Jest
  configuration, run commands.
- [`doc-internal/release-process.md`](./doc-internal/release-process.md) — release flow and what ships in the
  tarball.

Do **NOT** follow the consumer guide `doc/llms/llms.md` for authoring tasks. The `doc/` tree and the
`published-skills/mistica-react` skill describe how a downstream app _uses_ the published package; they are
the consumer surface and do not apply when editing this source. The develop-the-library skills live under
`.agents/skills/` and load automatically in this workspace.

**Package manager**: `yarn`

**Tooling**: yarn storybook (components live doc), yarn playroom (prototyping tool)

**Critical rules**:

- NEVER import `@vanilla-extract/css` in `.tsx` files (only in `.css.ts`)
- NEVER import `**/sprinkles.css` in `.tsx` files
- Always namespace React hooks: `React.useState`, `React.useEffect`
- Wrap unit tests with `ThemeContextProvider` + `makeTheme()`
- Prefer semantic queries (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`) over `getByTestId`

**Conventions**: `type` over `interface`, `export type` for types, `'use client';` for client components

**Components**:

- If you create a new component always create a snippet for playroom.
- If you add props to a component always update stories accordingly and add the new props to args and
  argTypes.

## GitHub conventions

- Read [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before creating a PR or contributing to Mistica repo.
- Always add the `AI` label to PRs where the code was written by an AI agent.
