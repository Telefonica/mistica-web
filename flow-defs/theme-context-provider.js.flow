   * You should use this prop if you use Strict Mode and Server Side Rendering together.

   * If no identifier is provided, this will fallback to an auto-incremented id, which will cause
   * problems in SSR + Strict Mode because the class names from client and server won't match.
   * More info: https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects
   *
   * Once we migrate to React18, we could remove this prop and use the useId hook instead.
